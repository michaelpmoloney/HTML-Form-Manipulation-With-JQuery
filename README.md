# HTML-Form-Manipulation-With-JQuery

#### Objective:
JQuery practice

#### Description:
A web page with an HTML form to make a payment. If Credit is selected an extra field appears to enter credit card information. If wire tranfer is selected, the following extra text appears: "Transfer the amount to: reg. $957.oo, to account 0009286322 (in English)". There is a drag-and-drop feature where items of a list of a class "removable" can be removed by draggin-and-dropping individual items from the list to a trashcan image. Whenever an item is moved to the trashcan, a dialog asks the user to confirm. Lastly, there is a "click for more information" feature where items of a list of class "informationable" can be clicked, in which case more information (fragments of HTML code) about the relevant item is retrieved from the server via AJAX.
